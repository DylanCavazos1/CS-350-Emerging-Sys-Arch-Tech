# CS-350-Emerging-Sys-Arch-Tech

**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**

The primary project for this course involved developing a smart thermostat prototype that was designed to read and control room temperature. The development of this thermostat helped to solve the problem of monitoring and control for users in a real-time environment. Users are able to manage their homes temperature settings to improve the efficiency and accurate monitoring of temperature management with smart home devices. 

**What did you do particularly well?**

The Smart Thermostat project provided an excellent foundation for developing my skills in logical design for embedded devices. Successfully configuring the sensor interface and integrating a state machine to manage temperature readings with LED control showcased my ability to transform requirements into a functional embedded application.

**Where could you improve?**

One area I could improve upon was understanding how to optimize UART and I2C communication, as I ran into trouble in initial configurations of timing and data flow. In future projects, I plan to bolster my understanding of peripheral timing and communication.

**What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?**

I mainly leveraged the built-in features of Code Composer Studio and the Resource Explorer, along with the technical documentation for the CC3220x. These were invaluable in helping to solve some compatability issues and improve my coding design. 

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?**

The skills from this project that I feel will benefit me the most include state machine design, peripheral configuration, and understanding of real-time embedded systems. These skills are transferable to other IoT and Computer Science disciplines with embedded applications. 

**How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

In order to make the project maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I tried implementing modular coding practices as well as separation of concern principles into the design of the program. This helped to improve the readability as well as make the project more adaptable to any future enhancements like implementing cloud connectivity for remote monitoring.
